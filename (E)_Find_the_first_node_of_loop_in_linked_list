Python solution for Find the first node of loop in linked list problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-first-node-of-loop-in-linked-list--170645/1
difficulty: easy
input is the head node of a linked list (node attributes are "data" and "next")
goal is to return the first node of the loop in the linked list, if one exists, otherwise return None
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
