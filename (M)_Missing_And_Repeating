Python solution for Missing And Repeating problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-missing-and-repeating2512/1
difficulty: medium
input is a list of positive integers of length n with one number from set 1, 2,...n missing and one number repeating
goal is to return a list made up of the repeating number followed by the missing number
