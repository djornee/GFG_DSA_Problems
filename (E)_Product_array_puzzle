Python solution for Product array puzzle problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/product-array-puzzle4525/1
difficulty: easy
input is an array of integers, arr
goal is to return an array where each index i has the product of all elements in arr except arr[i]
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
