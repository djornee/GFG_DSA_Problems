Python solution for Longest substring with distinct characters problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-distinct-characters-in-string5848/1
difficulty: easy
input is a string of lowercase letters, s
goal is to return the length of the longest substring of s made up of distinct characters
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
