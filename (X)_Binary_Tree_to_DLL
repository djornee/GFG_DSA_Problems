Python solution for Binary Tree to DLL problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-dll/1
difficulty: hard
input is the root node of a binary tree (node attributes are "left", "right", and "data")
goal is to do an in-place conversion of the tree to a doubly linked list,
following inorder traversal of tree, returning the head node of the list
