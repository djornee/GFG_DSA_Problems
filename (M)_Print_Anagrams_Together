Python solution for Print Anagrams Together problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-anagrams-together/1
difficulty: medium
input is a list of strings, arr
goal is to return a 2d list of the same strings, grouped together if they are anagrams, preserving order of appearance
in the original list (except that the 2d list is sorted alphabetically based on the first string in each group)
"""

class Solution:

    def anagrams(self, arr):
        
        # initialize dict to store sorted strings as keys and strings from arr as values
        resultDict = {}
        
        # loop through strings in arr, creating anagram groups in dict
        for s in arr:
            # create a string that is the sorted version of the string from arr
            ss = str(sorted(s))
