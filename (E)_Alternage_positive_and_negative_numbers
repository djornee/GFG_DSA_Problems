Python solution for Alternate positive and negative numbers problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-of-alternate-ve-and-ve-nos1401/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of positive and negative integers
goal is to return a list that alternates between the positive and negative numbers, starting with a positive and maintaining order as much as possible
*if there is an uneven number of positives and negatives, follow the pattern until running out of one or the other, then add remaining elements to the end
time complexity and auxiliary space are both O(n)
