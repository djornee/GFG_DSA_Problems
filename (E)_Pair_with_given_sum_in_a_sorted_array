"""
Python solution for Pair with given sum in a sorted array problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pair-with-given-sum-in-a-sorted-array4940/1
difficulty: easy
input is a sorted list of integers, arr, and an integer, target
goal is to return the number of pairs in arr that sum up to target
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
