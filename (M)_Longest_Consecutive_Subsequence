Python solution for Longest Consecutive Subsequence problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-consecutive-subsequence2449/1
difficulty: medium
input is a list of non-negative integers, arr
goal is to return the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers (can be spread throughout arr in any order)
