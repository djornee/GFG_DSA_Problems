Python solution for Minimize the Heights II problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-the-heights3351/1
difficulty: medium
inputs are a list of tower heights, arr, and a positive integer k
goal is to return the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after
having either added or subtracted k to/from each
"""
