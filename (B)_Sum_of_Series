Python solution for Sum of Series problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-series2811/1
difficulty: basic
input is an integer, n
goal is to return the sum of the series (1 + 2 + 3 + ... n)
time complexity and auxiliary space are O(1)
"""
class Solution:
    # finds average and multiplies by number of terms
    def seriesSum(self, n : int) -> int:
        # integer division to avoid using floats, prevents overflow issues
        roundAverage = (n + 1) // 2
        # if n is odd, the average of the terms would be a round number
        if n % 2 == 1:
            return roundAverage * n
        # n is even, so the average would be roundAverage + 0.5
        # returns roundAverage * n + 0.5 * n, but again using integer division to avoid floats
        return (roundAverage * n) + (n // 2)
