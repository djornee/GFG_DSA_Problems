Python solution for Not a subset sum problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-number-subset1220/1
difficulty: medium
input is a sorted list of positive integers
goal is to find the smallest positive integer that can't be represented as the sum of any subset of the list
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)

    """
    the logic behind the solution is, if arr[i] is not greater than current result, since we've already checked
    that 0,1...(result - 1) can be represented thus far, the next arr[i] values can also be represented by
    adding arr[i] to previous sums, so result is incremented by arr[i] to get the next possible result value
