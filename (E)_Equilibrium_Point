Python solution for Equilibrium Point problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/equilibrium-point-1587115620/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of integers, arr
goal is to return the index of the equilibrium point (index at which sum of all elements before == sum of all
elements after), if one exists, otherwise return -1
