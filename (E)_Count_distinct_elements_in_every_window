"""
Python solution for Count distinct elements in every window problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of integers, arr, and an integer, k
goal is to return a list of counts of distinct elements in every window of size k in arr
time complexity and auxiliary space are both O(n)
