Python solution for Value equal to index value problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/value-equal-to-index-value1330/1
difficulty: basic
input is a list of integers, arr
goal is to return the list of indexes (1-based indexing) of elements where value == index
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)

class Solution:
    # Function to find values in array equal to their indices

        # initialize return variable
        result = []
        # initialize index for 1-based indexing
        index = 1
        # loop through list values
        for i in arr:
            # value == index, add to result
            if i == index:
                result.append(i)
            # increment index for next loop iteration
            index += 1
        # solution list found
