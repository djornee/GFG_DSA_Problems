Python solution for Rotate and delete problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-and-delete-1587115621/1
difficulty: medium
input is a list of integers, arr
goal is to perform this operation k times, until one element is left: rotate list clockwise 1 and delete kth element from the last
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
"""

class Solution:
    def rotateDelete(self,  arr):
        # list only contains one element, no operations needed
        if len(arr) == 1:
            return arr[0]
        # initialize k, using negative indexing
        k = -1
        # loop until there are fewer elements left in the list than k
        while abs(k) <= len(arr):
            # rotate list clockwise once
            arr.insert(0, arr.pop())
            # remove kth from the last element
            arr.pop(k)
            # increment (decrement) k
            k -= 1
        # once k > len(arr), further operations will always leave the first element of the list the same
        return arr[0]
