Python solution for Max distance between same elements problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-distance-between-same-elements/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of integers, arr
goal is to return the maximum distance between two occurrences of the same integer value in the list
time complexity and auxiliary space are both O(n)
