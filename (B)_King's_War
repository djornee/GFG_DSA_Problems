Python solution for King's War problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kings-war2448/1
difficulty: basic
inputs are an array of soldiers and n, the length of the array
given that the king defeats all enemies with highest and lowest power (including duplicates),
goal is to find the number of remaining enemies that will require a soldier each to defeat
"""

class Solution:
    # finds number of weakest and strongest soldiers, subtracts from n

            return 0
