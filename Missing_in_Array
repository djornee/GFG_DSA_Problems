Python solution for Missing in Array problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of integers of size n - 1 that includes each integer from 1 to n except one
goal is to return the missing integer
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
"""

class Solution:
    # Note that the size of the array is n-1
    def missingNumber(self, n, arr):
        # ensure arr is sorted before looping
        arr.sort()
        # loop through list elements
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            # until missing element is encountered, all elements should equal index + 1
            if(arr[i] != i + 1):
                # missing element found
                return i + 1
        # missing element not in list, which just leaves off n at the end
        return n
