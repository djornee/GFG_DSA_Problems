Python solution for Roof Top problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/roof-top-1587115621/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list, arr, of heights of consecutive building
goal is to return the length of the longest subsequence of strictly increasing heights
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
