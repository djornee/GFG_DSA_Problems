"""
Python solution for Count the number of possible triangles problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-possible-triangles-1587115620/1
difficulty: medium
input is a list of positive integers, arr
goal is to return the number of triangles that can be formed with three different elements of arr as the lengths of the sides
time complexity is O(n^2), auxiliary space is O(1)
