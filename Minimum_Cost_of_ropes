Python solution for Minimum Cost of ropes problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes-1587115620/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of integers for lengths of ropes
goal is to return the minimum cost of connecting all ropes (to connect ropes a and b, cost = a + b)
"""

# solution involves turning the input list into a min heap, import required library
from heapq import *

    #Function to return the minimum cost of connecting the ropes.

        # turn arr into min heap

        cost = 0
        # loop until all ropes have been connected
        while len(arr) > 1:
            # remove two shortest ropes from heap and add their costs together
            ropes = heappop(arr) + heappop(arr)
