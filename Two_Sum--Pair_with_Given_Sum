Python solution for Two Sum - Pair with Given Sum problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/key-pair5616/1
difficulty: easy
input is a list of positive integers and a target sum, x
goal is to determine whether the sum of any two elements equals x
time complexity is O(n), auxiliary space is O(1)
