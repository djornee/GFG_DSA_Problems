Python solution for Print 1 To N Without Loop problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-1-to-n-without-using-loops-1587115620/1
difficulty: basic
input is a positive integer, N
goal is to print numbers from 1 to N recursively
time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1) or O(n) if you count the recursive stack
"""

class Solution:
    
    def printNos(self, N):
        # recursive function to print numbers from 1 to n
        def recursivePrint(n):
            # end recursive calls at 1
            if n == 1:
                # print 1 followed by a space instead of newline
                print(n, end = " ")
                return
            # recursively print 1 less than n
