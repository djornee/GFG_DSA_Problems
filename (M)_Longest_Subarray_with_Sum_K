Python solution for Longest Subarray with Sum K problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-sub-array-with-sum-k0809/1
difficulty: medium
input is an array of integers, arr, and an integer k
goal is to return the length of the longest subarray with sum equal to k, if any, otherwise return 0
"""
