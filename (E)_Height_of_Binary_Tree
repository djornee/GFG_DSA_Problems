Python solution for Height of Binary Tree problem at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/height-of-binary-tree/1
difficulty: easy
input is root node of a binary tree (nodes have properties data, left, right)
goal is to return the height of the tree
time complexity and auxiliary space are both O(n)
"""

class Solution:
    def height(self, root):
        # recursive function to find height of tree
        def getHeight(node):
            # passed edge of tree (node is None)
            if not node:
                return 0
            # recursive call, adds one to maximum height of left and right subtrees to get current node height
            return 1 + max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right))
        
        # return result of above recursive function    
        return getHeight(root)
